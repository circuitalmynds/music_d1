Held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, the two-day concert event raised funds for the Crossroads Centre in Antigua, the chemical dependency treatment and education facility that Clapton founded in 1998.

Lyrics:

The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You done me wrong, baby
You'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away from me
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

I'm free, free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
