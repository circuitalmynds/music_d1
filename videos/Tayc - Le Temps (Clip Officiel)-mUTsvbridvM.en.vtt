00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:33.685
Oh time, time has fixed me

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:35.685
Nothing is the same as before

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:37.956
Someone has already healed me

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:43.134
Ooh the wind, the wind has turned well

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.559
Don't waste my time

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.559
Another one knew how to heal me

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.810
You there you disappear without leave a note

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.464
You preferred to run away like a child, leave without looking back

00:00:58.464 --> 00:01:02.510
I lent you my heart and you gave it your back

00:01:03.138 --> 00:01:05.579
You made me waste my time,

00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:08.093
You didn't let me speak

00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:12.475
And now, you come back, and like before,

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:17.945
you hope to find the one who loved you, the one with whom you played

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:20.473
and now, now it's you who wants to talk

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.149
and all your best phrases you want to stall them

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.801
dont waste my time

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:30.857
oh the time, time has fixed me

00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:32.863
Nothing is the same as before

00:01:32.932 --> 00:01:34.932
Someone has already healed me

00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:40.199
Ooh the wind, the wind has turned well

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.199
Don't waste my time

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:45.243
Another man healed

00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:49.830
me Don't make me believe that I 'did not do the right thing

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:52.756
Me I made you come before everything

00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:55.515
I lost my reason

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:59.336
Without any remorse you threw everything into the water

00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:03.056
I had become addicted to your taste

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.560
The taste of your poison

00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:09.000
But now I'm okay with you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.469
I felt like I had to beg

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:14.634
For something you owe me no

00:02:15.513 --> 00:02:17.513
Now you finally want to hear me

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:20.192
We stopped you want to resume

00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:22.818
Don't waste my time

00:02:24.223 --> 00:02:27.828
